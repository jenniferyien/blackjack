GOAL:
The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21. You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards.

Cards and their value:
&#9656; 2 through 10: worth face value
&#9656; J, Q, and K: worth 10 points each

START GAME:

The best possible blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card. This is called a "blackjack", or a natural 21, and the player holding this automatically wins unless the dealer also has a blackjack.

&#9656; Stay: Keep his/her hand as it is.
&#9656; Hit: Take more cards from the deck, one at a time, until the player hand is strong enough or until it goes over 21, in which case the player immediately loses.

DETERMINING A WINNER:
