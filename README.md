### HOW TO PLAY: BLACKJACK
Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer.
Your only competition is the dealer.

### GOAL:
The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21. You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards.

> Cards and their value:
  - 2 through 10: worth face value
  - J, Q, and K: worth 10 points each
  - Ace: worth either 1 or 11 points

### START GAME:

The players and the dealer receive two cards each. The players' cards are dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down and one face up.
The best possible blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card. This is called a "blackjack", or a natural 21, and the player holding this automatically wins unless the dealer also has a blackjack.

### ACTIONS:

> Player goes first and can choose to:
  - Stay: Keep his/her hand as it is.
  - Hit: Take more cards from the deck, one at a time, until the player hand is strong enough or until it goes over 21, in which case the player immediately loses.

### DETERMINING A WINNER:

Once the players has finished playing, it is a Dealers turn to either decided to stay or bust, then the dealer turns over the hidden card.

> Player or Dealer wins if:
  - There is a natural blackjack (21)
  - The sum of the cards is higher than the other.

### SCORING POINTS:
1 Point is rewarded to winner of the game. In case of a Tie, neither party gets a point.

### HOW THE BUTTONS WORK:
  - New Game: Generates a new set of cards to play for next round of play.
  - Hit: Add a card to your hand.
  - Stay: Your turn is complete, Dealer's turn to finish round and winner is revealed.
  - Reset Game: Allows you to reset the score board and start fresh.
